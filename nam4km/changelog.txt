  Fixed "design flaw" wherein no date-appended BUFKIT files were available for export
  even when the user turned on the EXPORT_BUFKITP option in the configuration file.
  Now the --prepend option is turned ON when EXPORT_BUFKITP is defined.

  Corrected a problem in the sref_bufrinfo.conf file in that the unique BUFKIT description
  label had too many entries. Problem only appeared when viewing data in BUFKIT.

  By request, the Ensemble mean SREF member was moved to the top of the BUFKIT file.

  Hopefully fixed a problem with multiple bgruven processes running at the same time
  wherein one process would delete files being used by another. For example, if you were
  processing multiple SREF stations and another Bgruven began to process RAP stations,
  well then, lots of chaos and expletives but not much laughter would ensue.
  
  A preemptive strike to fixed a few bugs that may not actually exist by adding checks 
  for empty $mem and $stnm strings.
